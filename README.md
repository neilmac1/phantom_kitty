mischief and misinformation tools

I have two arduino scripts (for now) in this file.  

1) "fb_feed_fixer" randomly likes stories on a facebook timeline.  

2) "firefox_search" randomly conducts searches via a primitive method with a USB arduino like the beetle.  Make sure you enable "provide search suggestions" and "show search suggestions in address bar results."  Also press ctl-shift-del before using, select everything for time range and check "browing and download history" and "form and search history."  Just plug the arduino into a USB port to use, remove when done.  If you don't want to make your own, order it from <https://www.etsy.com/listing/788699447/phantom-kitty-usb-stick>
